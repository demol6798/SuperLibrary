#### Introduction

This is the official documentation of SuperLibrary. SuperLibrary is a collection of algorithms and data structures libraries in various programming languages. SuperLibrary implements the most useful algorithmic problems and data structures and can be essential reference guide for every computer scientist and software developer. Current version of SuperLibrary supports C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, and PHP programming languages.
Algorithms and data structures of SuperLibrary are commonly utilized in software development. In addition, they are the main subject of Computer Science study at universities and schools. SuperLibrary supports reusablity of frequently used code blocks intending to give software developers and computer scientists the opportunity to concentrate on the development of new procedures and concepts. Please, note that SuperLibrary is under Apache-2.0 License. 

#### Design and Architecture

The directory structure of SuperLibrary consists of four hierarchically organized levels. The first level includes the nodes of programming languages (e.g. C, C++, Java, etc.) which can be considered as root nodes in this context. The nodes at this level are expected increase with the growth and extension of SuperLibrary. Each root node has two child nodes — Algorithms and Data Structures. At this level, sibling nodes might be added in the future to further enhance code organization. One level below are the nodes of algorithmic methods and data types (e.g Dynamic Programming, Recursion, String, etc.). The elements of this level are structured in accordance with the main areas of Computer Science. Here each node includes code files — one file per algorithm.
